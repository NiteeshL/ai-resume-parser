# Resume Processor

Resume Processor is a Python-based application that extracts and processes information from resumes placed inside a GOOGLE DRIVE folder to reduce the hassle ðŸ˜‰. It uses the Gemini API to extract key details and calculate experience scores based on keyword matches.
Alternatively, it can also be used to process resumes present in the machine.

## Features

- Google drive integration (drive folder doesn't have to be publicly accessible ðŸ˜‰)
- Extracts text from PDF resumes
- Queries the Gemini API to extract key details from resumes
- Calculates experience scores based on keyword matches
- Provides a web interface for uploading and processing resumes

    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up Google Drive API credentials:
    - Follow the instructions to create a project and enable the Google Drive API: [Google Drive API Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python)
    - Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in the project root directory.

5. Create a Gemini API key:
    - Sign up for an account at [Gemini](https://gemini.com) if you don't have one.
    - Navigate to the API section and create a new API key.
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Gemini API key:
        ```dotenv
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
        ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
    ```sh
    python resume.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. Enter the Google Drive Folder ID containing the resumes in the input field and click "Process Resumes". The application can process a large number of resumes efficiently.

4. The application will process the resumes and save the extracted data to `raw_extracted_resumes_with_scores.xlsx`.
